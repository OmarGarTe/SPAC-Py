# SPAC-Py a model for Tree Transpiration Simulation under drip irrigation

This repository contains the code for a SPAC (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum) model developed to simulate olive tree transpiration as a function of wetted area and irrigation volume, using a multi-compartment soil solution approach.
The model was originally developed during the author's PhD research and has been used in the following peer-reviewed scientific publication:
